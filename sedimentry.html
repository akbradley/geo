    <p>
      Sedimentary rocks are formed by the consolidation of sediments which
      settle out of water, ice or air and are accumulated on the Earthâ€™s
      surface, on dry land or under water
    </p>

    <h2>Clastic</h2>
    <p>
      When composed of individual mineral or rock particles (clasts) derived
      from weathering and the erosion of older rocks they are known as clastic
      or detrital.
    </p>
    <h2>Nonclastic</h2>
    <p>
      When they originate from chemical precipitation (e.g. cave travertine) or
      from the biogenic action of organisms (e.g. coal, limestone) they are
      nonclastic.
