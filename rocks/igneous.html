    <p>
      Igneous rocks are formed when molten material from within the Earth,
      called magma, cools down and solidifies forming crystals. They are thus
      characterised by an interlocking crystalline texture.

    <h2>Intrusive</h2>
    <p>
      Intrusive (plutonic) rocks form when magma solidifies within the crust
      below the surface. It usually cools slowly and produces large crystals.
    </p>

    <h2>Extrusive</h2>
    <p>
      Extrusive (volcanic) rocks form when magma erupts onto the surface of the
      Earth as lava flows, and usually cools quickly producing small crystals.
      It can also erupt explosively as ash.
