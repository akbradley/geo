  <h1>Metamorphic rocks</h1>
  <img src="https://flexiblelearning.auckland.ac.nz/rocks_minerals/rocks/images/gneiss3.jpg" alt="metamorphic rock" height="100" width="100">
  <p>Metamorphic rocks are formed through the transformation of pre-existing rocks in a process known as metamorphism (meaning “change in form”). The original rock, or protolith, is subjected to heat and pressure which cause physical, chemical and mineralogical changes to the rock. Protoliths may be igneous, sedimentary or pre-existing metamorphic rocks.</p>

  <h2>Regional</h2>
  <p>Regional metamorphism usually results in the formation of rocks that are strongly foliated, such as slates, schists, and gneisses. The differential stress needed to produce such foliated rocks usually results from tectonic forces that produce compressional stresses in the rocks such as occur when two continental masses collide. Thus, regionally metamorphosed rocks are found in the cores of fold/thrust mountain belts or in eroded mountain ranges.  Compressive stresses result in folding of rock and thickening of the crust, which results in some of the rocks being pushed to deeper levels where they are subjected to higher temperatures and pressures</p>
  

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>Contact metamorphism typically occurs around intrusive igneous rocks, and is the result of temperature increase associated with the introduction of hot magma into the colder country rocks.  The area surrounding an intrusion, where metamorphism is present, is called a metamorphic aureole. Metamorphism is greatest closest to the intrusion and dissipates as distance from the intrusion increases.</p>
